There are several DOM Document and web crawlers available. 
I have used one of them to crawl persian news website, specially sport news.

Everything I have coded is in [index.php](https://github.com/SaeedTaghavi/crawler/blob/master/index.php), 
and the rest (like the [simple_html_dom.php](https://github.com/SaeedTaghavi/crawler/blob/master/simple_html_dom.php)) 
are the library I just have used.
